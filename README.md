## Overview

This is a challenge from Frontend Mentor that I made as an exercise to fix some concepts of HTML and CSS. Specially flexbox and grid, and also how to position elements on the screen more effectively.
The challenge took me 30 minutos to complete.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process
 My first step setting the new fonts and colors, and then reseting the box-sizing for the whole project so it wouldn't affect me later.
 After that, I created the container, defined the grids and then apllied the content to each div in accord to their function.
 For each div that I approached, I treated the style right away. It mught not be the best approach in larger projects, but in this case, I was possible to change the style as a coded.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I leraned more about flexbox and grid, and also good practices.
